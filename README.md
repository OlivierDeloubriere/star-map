Public transportation in the city of Rennes, France, is run by the STAR company and their open data are accessible via https://data.explore.star.fr/api/v1/console/datasets/1.0/search/

This project goals are:
- drawing the bus lines and the bus positions in real time on a map
- use only Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- use Leaflet to manipulate OpenStreetMap in Javascript.
